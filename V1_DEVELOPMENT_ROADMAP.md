## Success Metrics for v1.0.0

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Countries | 12+ | 8 | 🟡 In Progress |
| Performance | <1μs lookup | ~104ns | ✅ Exceeded |
| Test Coverage | 95%+ | ~90% | 🟡 Close |
| Documentation | Complete | Partial | 🔴 Needed |
| API Stability | Frozen | Beta | 🟡 Ready |

---

## Risk Assessment

### 🔴 **High Risk**
- **Documentation Gap**: Could delay v1.0 adoption
- **Breaking Changes**: API modifications after v1.0

### 🟡 **Medium Risk**  
- **Performance Regression**: New features impacting speed
- **Memory Usage**: Additional countries increasing footprint

### 🟢 **Low Risk**
- **Country Implementation**: Proven pattern established
- **Test Coverage**: Automated validation in place

---

## Decision Points

### **Should we implement more countries before v1.0?**
**Recommendation**: Yes, target 12 countries for global coverage
**Rationale**: Establishes GoHoliday as comprehensive solution

### **Should we include experimental features in v1.0?**
**Recommendation**: No, keep v1.0 stable and proven
**Rationale**: v1.0 should represent stability, not experimentation

### **Should we break API compatibility for v1.0?**
**Recommendation**: Minimal breaking changes only if critical
**Rationale**: Migration burden should be minimal

---

## Next Action Items

1. **Choose Priority**: Which priority should we tackle next?
2. **Scope Definition**: How comprehensive should the next iteration be?
3. **Timeline**: What's the target timeline for v1.0.0 release?

**Recommended Next Focus**: Priority 1 (Documentation) + Priority 2 (France/Brazil completion) for solid v1.0 foundation.
